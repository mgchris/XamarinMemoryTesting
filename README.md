Xamarin Memory Test App

This code is used to help me understand how memory works with Xamarin and iOS.   

One thing to note I am making the asumption that in my examples the finalizers will get called, when we select the garabage collector option.  They're a lot of cases where this will not happen, but given how this code is structured I believe it will.
